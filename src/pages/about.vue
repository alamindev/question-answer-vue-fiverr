              Welcome to our website. We represent a circle of private and institutional investors that have invested over 100 Million in different projects worldwide just last year.
              <br />
              <br /> Our goal is to select all potential projects and match them with our investors. 
To do so, we will make a first assessment and if It meets one of investors criteria’s we will put you in relation. 

              <br />
              <br />In cooperation with our network of investors ,we have built our rating tool based on a number of criteria’s that we have determined to be key decision’s points when looking into a project. 

              <br />We believe by sharing  this rating, it will helps you understand the worthiness of your project in the eyes of investor and how it competes against other ones.

              <br />In addition, you will have a  better understanding of where are the pain points and strong points of your project.  

              <br />You must also understand that not all investors have the same profile of investment. So whatever the rating of your project is, high or low, it needs to be assessed by a person of our team as we have different profile of investors that might match your criteria’s. 

              <br />
