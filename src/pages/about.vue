              Welcome to our website. We represent a circle of private and
              institutional investors that have invested over 100 Million in
              different projects worldwide just last year.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our goal is to select all potential projects and match them with
              our investors. We will make a first assessment and if It meets one
              of investors criteria’s we will put in relation.
              <br />
              <br />
              Here below you will find our investor rating tool. This tool will
              rate your project based on a number of criteria’s that we have
              determined to be key decision’s points when an investor analyses a
              project.<br />
              This rating helps you understand the worthiness of your project in
              the eyes of an investor. <br />
              It is a way to have better understanding of where are the pain
              points and strong points of your project.
              <br />
              Not all investors have the same profile of investment, so this why
              we have broad range of questions.
              <br />
              Whatever the rating of your project is, high or low, it needs to
              be assessed by a person of our team as we have different profile
              of investors that might match your criteria’s.
