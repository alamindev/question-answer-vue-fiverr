            >What are the criteria that Investors Use for selecting their Investments?</h4>
            <p class="investor__text">
              When it comes to investing in a start-up, investors look forward to supporting teams as well as entrepreneurs with one objective in mind i.e. to earn money. While, ethics and moral values are certainly important, but investors are also willing to invest in risky firms simply because they intend to maximize their profits from investments.
              With established firms, the process of determining investability and value is pretty straightforward. Established firms produce profits, sales as well as cash flows that are utilized for arriving at a reliable measure or value. But, in case of the start-ups, the investors (including the Angel investors and Venture Capitalists) have to put way more effort in terms of assessing the business as well as the opportunities for earning higher profits.

            >The Company</h4>
            <p class="investor__text">
              Investors come across a number of pitches on a daily basis. But, one of their first criteria for selecting a start-up for investment is to consider how different the company is. Thus, investors basically check how capable the start-up is when it comes to addressing the wants of the consumers. In fact, they also try to find out what the company has already accomplished and what remains to be achieved further.

            >Management team</h4>
            <p class="investor__text">
         Usually, the start-up organizations that achieve success are those that have an exceptional management team. A good management team works hard to convert their ideas into products/services. Investors are of the firm opinion that an ideal investment is one where the management members behind the start-up are capable enough to define the company’s future. They know that the management team is the one that would be taking decisions which would further help the firm to steer itself in the right direction. 
            <br> 
         One of the factors that investors keep in mind at the time of assessing the management team is whether it’s co-founders are business oriented and technically efficient or not. They also check whether the management members of the start-up complement each other or not. In addition to this, the prior experience of the team members is another important factor for going ahead with an investment decision. In essence, the investors want to see whether the management team is passionate, adaptable and dynamic or not. While, some investors want the management members to possess a mix of right skills, others want to invest in start-ups where the management team has achieved success before.

            >Market</h4>
            <p class="investor__text">
        The market size is another important factor for choosing an investment. Most of the investors are driven by the fact that the start-up that they are planning to invest in can at one or the other point become both huge and successful. In other words, the investors want high returns on investments or returns that can provide them with double or more the amount that they may have initially invested. Investors wish to know more about the actual market that is addressable by the start-up and the percentage of market that they intend to capture in the days to come. Typically, investors look for big market opportunities i.e. when the market size is over $1 billion in terms of annual sales. But remember, the market size isn’t very clear right at the beginning i.e. at the time when the start-up is being launched. Given such a scenario, they rely on their instincts and past experiences before going ahead with their investment decision.

            >Product and service</h4>
            <p class="investor__text">
       It is never easy for the investors to judge the prototype of the product being launched by a start-up. In such a case the investors are required to take a decision around investment on the basis of their gut feelings or even their prior experience in the area. Also, there isn’t any guarantee that a great product will attract high investments. There are many start-up firms that have introduced a great product, but have failed to acquire any users as well as traction. Sometimes this happens because the product in itself wasn’t solving the problem or because it wasn’t an appropriate time for launching it. Put simply, investors are always keen on investing in start-ups that offer excellent products & services which are both competitive and long lasting. They are searching for products/services that offer solution to an existing problem which other companies within the marketplace have not been able to solve. They want to invest in products as well as services which customers can't seem to do without simply because it is very affordable or ideal for solving their problem.

            >Fundraise</h4>
            <p class="investor__text">
      Last but not the least, many investors also check whether the start-up is ready for fund raising or not. Typically, start-ups need to present certain documents before the investors which will help them in evaluating whether the firm is ideal for investment or not. Investors are interested in companies that truly understand their financials as well as their key business metrics. Thus, investors look for start-ups that are clear about the funds that they want to raise. Start-ups should be able to outline their funding objectives and goals. These goals as well as objectives are usually included within the business plan and later within the investor's pitch deck. Remember, in the absence of these as well as other relevant documents, investors will find it difficult to understand where their funds will exactly be allocated. Also, investors also check how their investment funds will help the organization is succeeding in the long run.

            >Conclusion</h4>
            <p class="investor__text">
      To sum up, investors look forward to weeding out investments that they feel will fail to provide them with high returns. Typically, they try to avoid opportunities that seem way too attractive in terms of their business plan and promises. While, they are interested in exploring business ideas that are truly unique, they obviously try to avoid start-ups that do not offer a proven service or product. The bottom line is that investors are always interested in investing in start-ups that have an excellent founding or management team and a traction gaining or revenue generating product/service.
